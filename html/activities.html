                                <p>This is a python library which let's the user create any complex topologies using concepts such as namespaces, virtual machine and also run tests on them similar to tools like netperf etc. This reduces the burden of running simulators on multiple systems</p>

                                <p>This is an android app that enables the labourers and customers connect without a middleman. This uses location based services, rating system, cost balance through online demands, specification of the work and many such features</p>

                                <p>This is a C++ project that aims at simulating the working of a Cache. There are multiple features that a user can vary such as cache-size, line-size, caching algorithm, block-size and so on to test which combination works best for the given program</p>

                                <p>This is an optimised implementation of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm on CUDA to parallelize it. It has both 1D and 2D versions. There is also an frequency filter application built using this, to compare the parallel implementation with the series one.</p>
